# GeneralizedHammingScheme
This code is executed on GAP (version 4.11).
On GAP prompt (gap>) execute each line of code sequentially.
The code also displays the expected output after execution.

## Theoretical background
The code implements following cases of the Generalized Hamming scheme on a strongly regular graph:
1) The general case for an arbitrary rank 3 scheme.
2) Paley graphs
3) Johnson graph
4) Complete Bipartite graph
